# FaceDetection
Digital forencsis project


Face Detection and Face Recognition have become interesting areas in research application of pattern recognition and computer vision during the last years. They play a vital role in several applications, from surveillance systems to criminology. However, the Face Recognition task is still complex in computer vision, especially due to the high degree of varation of human faces. The main aim of this work is to present an Artificial Intelligence (AI) - based face recognition system adapted to the temporal dimension for videos face recognition. After a brief introduction, some theorethical insights regarding the face recognition task and CNNs will be proposed. Then, results and the performance of our face recognition strategy will be presented and discussed. We conclude this work with some discussions on how the strategy could be further imporved.
